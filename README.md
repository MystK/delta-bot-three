## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.

### Commit Message Format
Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

Footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any.

Samples: (even more [samples](https://github.com/angular/angular/commits/master))

```
docs(changelog): update change log to beta.5
```
```
fix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js

The version in our package.json gets copied to the one we publish, and users need the latest of these.
```

### Revert
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### How to build
1. Download nvm. Mac/Linux: https://github.com/creationix/nvm Windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/download/1.1.1/nvm-setup.zip
1. `git clone https://github.com/MystK/delta-bot-three.git`
1. `cd delta-bot-three`
1. Mac/Linux: `nvm install` Windows: Look inside the .nvmrc folder to find the version. EX: 5.8.0 is the version. `nvm install 5.8.0 && nvm use 5.8.0`
1. Create a subreddit. After creation, ensure that "mod editing" for the subreddit's wiki is enabled, and make your bot account a moderator for the subreddit.
1. Get a Reddit API key by going to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/ => create another app => https://i.imgur.com/xMUa521.png. The bot account be a developer of the app.
1. Create a `credentials.json` that looks like below in `./config/credentials` folder.
1. Create a `config.json` that looks like below in `./config` folder.
